DevTinder is a full-stack application inspired by Tinder, designed to connect developers. Iâ€™m currently working on implementing chat functionality using Socket.IO. The project focuses on creating a robust full-stack application that enables users to send connection requests to each other, and once connected, they can chat in real-time.
